# React challenge: Tribble

## Challenge description
1. Create an element which moves in any direction by animating it (use plain React or CSS, whatever works best; CSS support is added to the setup).
2. Create a way for the user to add new instances of the element created in #1.
3. Create a way for the user to input and change the color of the elements already created.

* A solution could possibly look like the one shown at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um7x3zQQ4Fs
* You are encouraged to improvise as long as the 3 requirements mentioned above are completed.
* **This should take you anywhere between 15 minutes and 1 hour to complete.**

## Things we'll look for
1. A component-based approach.
2. Proper use of state and props.
3. Reasonable abstraction / code structure (you should be able to explain it).
4. When/if you choose to use CSS/SCSS/etc. over "plain" JS (lol, it is transpiled, you know what we mean).

### Bonus points
5. Spend a few minutes to document your approach (from reading the challenge description up to the final solution).
6. We do NOT expect you to write tests for components. But if you feel adventurous, feel free to show off.
